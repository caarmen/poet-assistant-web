Poet Assistant Website Privacy Policy
=====================================

The Poet Assistant single page web app is open source. You can see
exactly what it does by looking at the source code:

https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant-web

Poet Assistant's source code only makes requests to the Poet
Assistant website to load the source code of the app (javascript,
html, css, fonts) required for the app to function.

Poet Assistant doesn't include tracking of words you search or the
poem you type.

Voice playback (text to speech)
-------------------------------
The app provides a feature where you can play back text using the
voices provided by your operating system.

This feature is available:
* in the Reader tab
* when clicking on a word in the search results, and selecting the
  "Speak" option

Depending on your operating system, and depending on the selected
voice, your operating system or speech synthesis software may send
the text to be played back to a remote server. Poet Assistant does
not send this data, and the maintainers of Poet Assistant don't have
access to this data. Consult the manuals of your operating system or
speech synthesis software to know how this data is used.

Log Files
---------
The Poet Assistant website follows a standard procedure of using log
files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting
companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics. The
information collected by log files include internet protocol (IP)
addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and
time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks.
These are not linked to any information that is personally
identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends,
administering the site, tracking users' movement on the website, and
security purposes.

Local storage
-------------
The app saves some settings to local storage. This remains on your
device and can't be read by any server.

The settings are:
* selected voice
* voice pitch
* voice speed
* rhymer syllable matching settings
* thesaurus settings
* poem text
* searched words

Summary
-------
This app is a hobby app. The developer makes no income from it. There
are no ads. The developer is only interested in learning new skills
and sharing the application with anybody who may find it useful. The
developer doesn't care about your data, what words you search for, or
what poems you create (sorry).
