Poet Assistant Desktop Privacy Policy
=====================================

Poet Assistant for desktop is a downloadable executable for MacOS,
Windows, or Linux.

Poet Assistant is open source. You can see exactly what it does by
looking at the source code:

https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant-web

Poet Assistant's source code doesn't send data to any remote server.

Voice playback (text to speech)
-------------------------------
The app provides a feature where you can play back text using the
voices provided by your operating system.

This feature is available:
* in the Reader tab
* when clicking on a word in the search results, and selecting the
  "Speak" option

Depending on your operating system, and depending on the selected
voice, your operating system or speech synthesis software may send
the text to be played back to a remote server. Poet Assistant does
not send this data, and the maintainers of Poet Assistant don't have
access to this data. Consult the manuals of your operating system or
speech synthesis software to know how this data is used.

Local storage
-------------
The app saves some settings to local storage. This remains on your
device and can't be read by any server.

The settings are:
* selected voice
* voice pitch
* voice speed

Summary
-------
This app is a hobby app. The developer makes no income from it. There
are no ads. The developer is only interested in learning new skills
and sharing the application with anybody who may find it useful. The
developer doesn't care about your data, what words you search for, or
what poems you create (sorry).
